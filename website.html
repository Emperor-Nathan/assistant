    <h1>Custom Commands for Amazon's Alexa</h1>
    <h2>Nathan Holmes-King<br>Siddharth Srinivasan</h2>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>This program allows the user to input a custom name for a command. Then, the user can use any name they want for that command.</p>
        <p>The user can also have Alexa list all the names for a certain command.</p>
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>If Alexa does not come in a user's native language, they can translate it into their language without having to wait for Amazon to do it. Also, Amazon can quickly translate without having to re-write any code.</p>
        <p>Also, everyone can use shorthand as an alternative to saying long commands.</p>
